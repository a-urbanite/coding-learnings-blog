# My Coding Blog

as i descend deeper into the beautiful madness of the programming world i needed to outsouce things from my brain. it is my style of learning that i write down things. When i write them i am explaining them to me again and the coherence of the text indicates to me the coherence of my thoughts. To have a tool for that available everywhere and to be able to share my insights i set up this blog 

## Functionality

All CRUD operations have been implemented in the UI. The blog has a couple of convenience functions that you would expect there like sorting functions, pagination, an interactive tag cloud, a search bar etc.

## Tech stack

This blog was built in React/Typescript, using Firestore as a DB and Firebase for authentication. Quill.js is being used to set up Rich Text capabilities.
